# Flappy-Bird
Flappy Bird Game built using JavaScript

It makes use of concepts like infinite scrolling of game objects and background.

The player controls a small bird that constantly moves forward in a horizontal direction. The game environment consists of pipes arranged vertically with gaps in between. The pipes appear at regular intervals, and the bird must pass through the gaps to score points. If the bird touches the pipes or the ground, the game ends.
